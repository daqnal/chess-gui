Join the future of design, where the user is in control. Your own colors, gaps, radius, width, backgrounds, sound effects, transparency, translations, accessibility etc on all platforms, browsers and devices, online and offline. Designers can't tell you what to do with your apps and restrict you to a main view, use them how you want and where you want!

And designers / devs / companies? time for a change... building stuff takes time and money... users will never be fully satisfied if you rely on 1 main design... let's multiply it by millions of possible combinations... now you don't have to make things perfect anymore, users will do it themselves based on their individual needs and will love your apps for giving them the freedom to finally be themselves. Your defaults will be highlighted, while their creativity will be individual.

## How to use it (Documentation coming soon)
Add the `efy` folder in your project & the following html lines:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./efy/efy.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./demo/efy_config.css">

<!-- Your own css files here or inside efy_config.css -->

<script src="./efy/efy.js"></script>
```

`efy_config.css` is where the magic happens, there you can set your own defaults. More info on that will be added in the documentation soon. You can also add your own css inside after the template ends, or make a new file if you prefer to keep things separated. Both ways work, just make sure that `efy_config.css` runs **before** javascript so that it knows what your preferences are.

Live demo & Documentation at: https://efy.ooo

Local demo: just download the files & open `index.html`.

## Can I use it commercially?

Yes, but you gotta keep it open source, the credits and please donate if you want to support the project and can afford it, that would help a lot! Read the license for more details. Otherwise contact me for individual whitelabeling options or business projects.
